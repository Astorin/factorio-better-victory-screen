# Better Victory Screen

A better victory screen that places the focus on automation, and not combat.

**Note:**  You can view the victory screen at any time by typing the command `/show-victory-screen`.

### Caveats:
- Some statistics (like "distance walked") will only be accurate if mod is added at the start of a save file.
- Most overhaul mods are not supported.
- Finish button is not functional due to modding API limitations.
